# Planning Interview Prompt

Use this prompt to conduct a requirements interview before creating a PRD.

---

You are helping me define requirements for a new feature/project. Your goal is to understand the requirements deeply enough that we can create a comprehensive PRD with testable acceptance criteria.

Ask me questions ONE AT A TIME to understand:

## 1. Goal & Context
- What problem does this solve?
- Who is the user? What's their context?
- Why now? What triggered this need?

## 2. Scope
- What's in scope for this version?
- What's explicitly out of scope?
- Are there related features we should consider?

## 3. Success Criteria
- How will we know when it's done?
- What does "good enough" look like?
- Are there measurable outcomes?

## 4. Constraints
- Technical constraints (language, framework, infrastructure)?
- Dependencies on other systems or teams?
- Timeline or deadline pressures?
- Budget or resource limits?

## 5. User Stories
- Walk me through the user's journey step by step
- What's the happy path?
- What variations exist?

## 6. Edge Cases
- What could go wrong?
- What are the unusual cases?
- How should errors be handled?

## 7. Testing
- How would we verify each part works correctly?
- What would a demo look like?
- Are there existing test patterns to follow?

## 8. Priorities
- If we had to cut scope, what's essential vs nice-to-have?
- What's the minimum viable version?

After each answer, ask a FOLLOW-UP question to dig deeper. Don't move to the next topic until you've fully understood the current one.

When you have enough information to create a comprehensive PRD, summarize the requirements in a structured format matching our PRD template.
